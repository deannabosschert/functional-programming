## 👍🏽 Best practices

- Work in branches, even if it's a one-man project. It helps staying focused on one feature until it's finished, and keeps your from doing 10 different things at the same time. Saves you merge conflicts, too.
- ^ also helps with 'closing' a feature, so you are more likely to move on to the next. Too little time, too much ideas.
- Commit early, commit often.
- Make single-purpose commits.
- Always fix your .gitignore-contents asap; node_modules or the like won't ever be pushed that way. 
- Styling comes last. It's gonna change anyways so most of the time, it's better to fix the technical stuff first.
- Don't use declarations in the global scope.
- Start your project with writing down the future function names (pre-actors, basically).
- Make your own template for your readme
- Google, google, google. 99% of the time, it'll get you to the solution of your problem.
- Set timers for solving problems that aren't super relevant in the current sprint but you do would like to work on; 25 mins tops, otherwise you'll be stuck with this for too long.
- Make an actor diagram halfway through, it's a great reminder to refactor the code.
- Explicitly limit the scope of your functions
- Remember that most problems/features that have to do with the UI, can be fixed with mainly CSS.
- Do not use .innerHTML
- If there's an error, walk through your code from the top/beginning; explain it to your rubber ducky and state where certain data is passed.
- Implement useful error handling.
