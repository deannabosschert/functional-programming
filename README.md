## 🌍 Design patterns

- opsomming
- van
- patterns

## 👍🏽 Best practices
- Make sure everything's in functions. No global stuff!
- Keep your functions as 'to the point' as possible; every function should return 1 thing.


## 🗃 Data

### 🐒 API
_What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties?_

Volkskrant's API!

#### Properties

#### Rate limiting

### 💽 Data cleaning
_What has been done with the fetched data?_What has been done with the initial data? Cleaning pattern?

See my [Wiki](https://github.com/deannabosschert/functional-programming-2021/wiki/Data-opschonen) for a more detailed view.

```js
```

outcome:
```json
```

## 👯🏿‍ Features (+ wishlist)
_What would you like to add (feature wishlist / backlog)?_

- [ ] Some script that automatically writes the cleaned data to my 'data'-folder
- [ ] second something
- [ ] third thing
